#spotify-dashboard

##First Thoughts
Get a variety of data from users Spotify account via Spotify API`s like as most listening artist, most listening song, time user was listening music on Spotify, etc..
Visualize the data in graphs on a daily, weekly or monthly base.

This project is on hold, because we do not get a lot of personalized data from the Spotify API. Maybe someday in the future.
